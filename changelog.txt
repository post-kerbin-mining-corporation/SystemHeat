v0.5.0
------
- Marked for KSP 1.12
- Removed nuclear fuel container inventory item as it no longer has a purpose
- NTRs:
 - Changed how NTRs work again
  - NTRs do not fully participate in the thermal system unless sufficiently high power that they have waste heat (GCRs, etc) or power-generating (trimodal)
  - NTRs have sticky engine throttles similar to jet engines that approximate the need to cool the reactor during startup and shutdown. These are similar to the current timings (~5-10s for 0-100, 2.5-5s for 100-0)
  - Higher power NTRs (gas core) generate simple extra heat when running similar to FFT engines and are balanced similarly
  - Editor UI shows only things that need to be compensated for all NTRs, this is limited to waste heat from power generation heat and extra heat from powerful engines. 
  - Non-trimodal NTR reactors have less user features than reactors:
   - No minimum throttle
   - Fuel burn rate directly tied to throttle, fuel loads generally reduced to provide meaningful gameplay 
   - It is not possible to accidentally damage the reactor core
   - Hibernate/manual control are disabled as they are not needed

 - Corrected nuclear fuel transfer not working on non-english localizations
 - Screen message now emitted when fission reactor forces an engine shutdown for some reason
 - Additional fission reactor state change log messages for debugging

 - Added new ignoreTemperature field to ModuleSystemHeat, which causes the module to be ignored for the purposes of loop nominal temperatures (set to true on coolant tanks, radiators, etc)
 - Added ModuleSystemHeatAsteroidHarvester, 
 - Added ModuleSystemHeatBaseConverterAdapter, a new module that can adapt anything derived from BaseConverter to SH
 - ModuleSystemHeatFissionReactor can now have allowHibernate and allowManualControl specified in config; this disables the ability

  - Reduced Nerv fuel load to 10 units of EnrUranium, reduces total burn time from 8 days to 1.6 days
